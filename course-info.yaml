language: English
summary: Having the option to read online documentation or find something on the Internet
  from the command line or terminal can really come in handy. Let's use Python to
  create a text-based browser. In this project, you will create a simplified browser
  that will ignore JS and CSS, won't have cookies, and only will show a limited set
  of tags. But it will still be good enough for some situations, and building it will
  be fun!<br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org">https://hyperskill.org/projects/79</a>
